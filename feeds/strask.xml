</li>

<li>
How would you respond to the claim that being “woke” is simply being aware of racial and social justice issues, and that Jesus was woke, therefore it’s a positive trait?

<ul><li>
What’s your response to a church bulletin that said, “The point of Old Testament justice is the protection of the poor and powerless; it recognizes that the rich and powerful never come to the table equal and neutral because they own the table”?
</li>

<li>
How would you respond to the claim that being “woke” is simply being aware of racial and social justice issues, and that Jesus was woke, therefore it’s a positive trait?

When do you take seriously a profession of faith from a child?

All else being equal, is it better to be at a church where you agree with every single doctrine, but the community isn’t close-knit, or a church where the community is terrific, but you disagree on some non-essentials?
